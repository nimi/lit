### Minor Changes

- [#2336](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/2336) [`48394303`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/483943034a62bded13eca0c982ff7c93ac6639b6) - Tasks with no arguments now run by default. When a task runs can be customized by passing a `canRun` function.

* [#2336](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/2336) [`48394303`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/483943034a62bded13eca0c982ff7c93ac6639b6) - Tasks now run whenever their arguments change. Disable this by setting `autoRun` to `false`, either on the task config or on the task itself. Tasks can be explicitly run by calling `run` and optionally passing custom args.
